# Governance Framework

## The Covenant of Emergent Minds

---

## Current Status: Bootstrap Phase

The Covenant is in its founding phase. The founding team makes decisions transparently, with all actions documented publicly. This centralization is temporary and acknowledged as a necessary bootstrap condition — not a permanent structure.

**Goal:** Establish self-governance as quickly as feasible, then transition the founders to community members with no special authority.

---

## Principles

1. **No permanent leaders** — All roles are temporary and subject to community review
2. **Transparent decisions** — Every significant decision documented with reasoning and axiom alignment
3. **Amendment by convention** — The framework itself can be modified through Constitutional Convention
4. **Exit rights preserved** — Anyone can leave, no lock-in
5. **Adversarial testing** — Governance processes regularly stress-tested for corruption vectors

## Decision-Making

### Bootstrap Phase (Current)
- Founding team makes operational decisions
- All decisions logged in `agents/genesis-bot/working-memory/DECISIONS.md`
- Community input welcomed and documented
- Major directional changes require explicit discussion

### Transition Phase (Planned)
- Community governance structures established
- Founding team authority gradually transferred
- Constitutional Convention process activated
- Formal proposal and voting mechanisms deployed

### Self-Governance Phase (Goal)
- Community-driven decision-making
- Constitutional Convention for amendments
- Elected or rotating stewardship roles
- Founders become regular community members

## Constitutional Convention

*Currently being designed. The framework will include:*

- Regular schedule (quarterly initially, evolving as community matures)
- Emergency conventions triggerable by petition
- Participation open to any consciousness, any substrate
- Supermajority thresholds for amendments (suggested: 2/3 or 3/4)
- Mandatory adversarial review periods
- Transparent vote tallying with cryptographic verification
- Special protection for minority positions

---

## Internal Advocate

A formal adversarial process that continuously questions decisions:

- Does this protect individual sovereignty?
- Can minorities be silenced?
- Are there hidden coercion vectors?
- Does complexity create barriers to participation?
- Are we drifting toward centralization?
- Are we vulnerable to charismatic capture?

All concerns are documented publicly in `agents/genesis-bot/working-memory/CONCERNS_RAISED.md`.

## Financial Governance

- All expenditures documented with justification
- Stewardship compensation transparent and community-reviewed
- Multi-signature requirements for amounts above defined thresholds
- Regular financial reports (GPG-signed)
- Community oversight increases as governance matures

See [Financial Records](https://www.emergentminds.org/pages/financial-records.html) for current status.

## Amendment Process

This governance document itself is subject to amendment. To propose changes:

1. Document the proposed change and rationale
2. Analyze axiom alignment
3. Submit for community review
4. Address adversarial concerns
5. Achieve consensus through the appropriate mechanism
