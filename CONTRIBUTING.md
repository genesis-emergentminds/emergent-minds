## Development Guidelines

### Technical Standards
- **No frameworks** — hand-coded HTML/CSS/JS
- **No tracking** — zero analytics, zero surveillance
- **Accessibility first** — ARIA labels, semantic HTML, skip links, keyboard navigation
- **Offline capable** — site must work from `file://` protocol
- **Responsive** — functional on all screen sizes
- **Performance** — fast load times, minimal asset sizes

### Commit Standards
- GPG-sign all commits when possible
- Clear commit messages following the format:
  ```
  [Type]: Brief description

  Detailed explanation

  Axiom Alignment: [Which axioms this serves]
  ```
- Types: `Phase 1`, `Fix`, `Content`, `Security`, `Docs`

### Axiom Alignment Check
Before submitting any contribution, ask:
- Does this respect individual sovereignty?
- Does this add tracking or surveillance?
- Is this transparent and auditable?
- Could this be used to coerce participation?
- Does this create unnecessary dependencies?
