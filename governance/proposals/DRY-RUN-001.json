Maintain the existing Matrix space as the primary community hub\n2. Document Matrix as the recommended platform in all onboarding materials\n3. Ensure Threshold bot is operational in the Welcome room\n4. Evaluate bridge needs (IRC, XMPP) based on community demand\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f DRY RUN NOTICE\nThis is a governance infrastructure test. The proposal text is realistic but this is NOT a binding or advisory vote. It exists to validate that the proposal submission, voting, and verification pipeline works correctly end-to-end.",

      "axiom_v": "Decentralized protocol, open source, E2EE \u2014 resilient against censorship, surveillance, and single points of failure."
    },
    "adversarial_analysis": "Primary risk: Matrix.org homeserver centralization (most users default to matrix.org). Mitigation: document self-hosting options, encourage federation. Secondary risk: E2EE complexity for bots. Mitigation: use unencrypted rooms for bot interaction, encrypted for sensitive discussions.",
    "rollback_plan": "If Matrix proves inadequate, the community can adopt any alternative platform via a standard amendment. All Matrix content can be exported. No infrastructure lock-in.",
    "advocate_response": "Internal Advocate notes: Matrix is well-aligned with axioms. Primary concern is the practical barrier of requiring Matrix account creation \u2014 ensure the Join page provides clear instructions and that alternative participation paths exist for those unable or unwilling to use Matrix."
